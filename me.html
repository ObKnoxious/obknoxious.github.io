		<h4>About me</h4>
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<p>My name is Knox Crichton, and I'm a Computer Science student and departmental IT asssitant at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I'm a nerd, a gamer, a Cloud9 superfan, PC and Linux enthusiest, and a follower of Christ. I have some other hobbies, I love tinkering with RGB lights and old game consoles; and I'm always listening to music (usually Kpop). I've also taking up cooking as a pandemic hobby. I grew up in Knoxville and an alumin of Hardin Valley and their FRC team, 3824 The RoHAWKtics. I have traveled to all 50 states and three countries, and hope to increase that soon. </p>
		<h4>FAQ</h4>
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h5><i>Is Knox your real name?</i></h5>
		<p>Its on my birth certificate. While I was born and raised in Knoxville, it's not what I'm named after. My parents got the name from the charachter Knox Overstreet in the movie <i>Dead Poet's Society</i></p>
		<h5><i>You do what for work?</i></h5>
		<p>I work in the Tickle College of Engineering's Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciece Department (EECS). My work consists of managed IT support for the students and faculty of the department along with deployment of new systems, surplus of retired systems, and maintenence of the department's servers. </p>
		<h5><i>What games do you play?</i></h5>
		<p>I play all sorts of things. I grew up with Nintendo games and love Mario, Pokemon, Zelda, Pikmin, WarioWare, along with basically the entire GameCube Library. My most played game is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive which occupied nearly all of my free time in high school. I do most of my gaming on PC now along with my Switch.</p>
		<h5><i>What computer do you use?</i></h5>
		<p>I spend most of my time on my custom built desktop, Amy. She is  powered by a Ryzen 7 3700X and an RTX 2080 SUPER, housed within a "tall but small" Mini-ITX case. I also have Tifa, a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga laptop, and Lisa, a custom built 10TB NAS for storage.<p>
		<h5><i>What Linux distro are you running?</i></h5>
		<p>KDE Neon, which runs on top of Ubuntu LTS. I also use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for work. All of my computers have custom themes based on solarized by Ethan Schoonover.</p>
		<h5><i>Have you actually been to all 50 states?</i></h5>
		<p>Yep! My dad travelled all around the country for work when I was growing up, and when we could me and my mom would tag along. My parents made it a goal for us to see all 50 states and planned our vacations around visiting new ones. I visited my last state, Oregon, before I graduated high school.</p>
		<h5><i>Why is everything pink?</i></h5>
		<p>Pink is my favorite color! #F06292 is what is the primary color on the website but in general I am a fan of neon pink based color schemes. The "Neon Revolution" from CSGO is my favourite example of this.</p>
